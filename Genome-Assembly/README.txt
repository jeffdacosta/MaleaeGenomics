This directory contains SLURM scripts and dependancy files that were used for de novo assemblies in AllPaths-LG. Assemblies were created on the "bigmem" partition of the Harvard Odyssey computer cluster, which contains nodes with 64 cores and 513 GB of RAM.

The first step is to create dependancy lib and group files that contain details on the sequenced libraries. These are used by AllPaths-LG (script: PrepareAllPathsInputs.pl) to prep the data for assembly. The command line for prepping the data is contained in the PrepAllPaths.sh SLURM file. The assembly is then launched in AllPaths-LG (command: RunAllPathsLG), and the command line for this is contained in RunAllPaths.sh
