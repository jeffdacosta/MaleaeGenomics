This repository contains commands, scripts, and other material used for the project "Comparative genomics of a species radiatio: sequencing the apple tribe." Material will be updated periodically, and raw data will be available upon publication.

Disclaimer: most of the materials are specific to this project and the Harvard Odyssey supercomputer cluster. Many files are submissions to the cluster using the SLURM job control system, which define run parameters (e.g., time, memory), software/dependency modules, and command lines. Although these files are specific to this cluster, command lines could be modified for other systems.
